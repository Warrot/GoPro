# GoPro

This projects involves trying to make my GoPro HERO 3+, to: 
	connect to my raspberry pi via wifi
	turn on at sunrise/sunset
	take three photos
	upload them to my pi
	turn off


Current problems involve:
	The pi is not able to connect to the AdHoc network created by the GoPro, while still being connected to internet via ethernet.
